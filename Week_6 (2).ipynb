Правда, в задаче нашего соревнования при бинарной классификации веб-сессий мы разницы не заметим – как по качеству, так и по скорости работы (хотя можете проверить), продемонстрируем всю резвость VW в задаче классификации на 400 классов. Исходные данные все те же самые, но выделено 400 пользователей, и решается задача их идентификации. Скачайте данные отсюда – файлы train_sessions_400users.csv и test_sessions_400users.csv.**"
